MY NEIGHBORHOOD MAP APPLICATION


*****Project Overview*****

You will develop a single page application featuring a map of your neighborhood or a neighborhood you would like to visit. You will then add additional functionality to this map including highlighted locations, third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content.

This is a single page application featuring a map of my neighborhood, Charlotte, NC. The attached video is an interesting perspective of the county in which Charlotte, NC is located.  I have also included 5 area sites that any one visiting the area would want to check out.  Regional images are also included as well as a searchable map at the end of the page.

*****Functionality of the Application*****

First, launch the myNeighborhood.html file in a web browser. The embedded video source is YouTube. The regional images are from Flicker and the maps are powered by Google Maps.  This application is also compatible with mobile phones and tablets because of the responsive design.

The app has interactivity: you can filter items already listed in the first map and even drag an icon and place it on a location and let people know what you found interesting.  In the second map, you can search for items that you are looking for, like gas, food, coffee, etc. Type coffee for example, and you find get a list of coffee places in my neighborhood. Pick a place from the list, and the map will take you there. The app uses Knockout for data binding of the locations already listed on the map, and uses Google Map API autocomplete function to search nearby locations.



*****The Project*****

How will I complete this Project?

Review our course JavaScript Design Patterns.
Download the Knockout framework.
Write code required to add a full-screen map to your page using the Google Maps API.
Write code required to add map markers identifying a number of locations you are interested in within this neighborhood.
Implement the search bar functionality to search and filter your map markers. There should be a filtering function on markers that already show up. Simply providing a search function through a third-party API is not enough.
Implement a list view of the identified locations.
Add additional functionality using third-party APIs when a map marker, search result, or list view entry is clicked (ex. Yelp reviews, Wikipedia, Flickr images, etc). If you need a refresher on making AJAX requests to third-party servers, check out our Intro to AJAX course.
